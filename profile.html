          <p>Hi I'm Meghan, a computer science and mathematics double major at Simmons College. I am excited about having a new roommate because meeting new people is a potentially rewarding experience. I find myself to be a friendly person and think I get along with others well. I would like to be best friends with my roommate! I am a very good student and take my studies very seriously. I don't mind noise in our room, and quiet is fine too. I don't really go out too much on the weekends but every once in a while I will. Mostly, I'll just hang out with friends. I feel as though I am a good problem solver but may need an outside perspective every once in a while. I don't mind confiding in my roommate. I would say I am good at handling stress most of the time. I am so excited!!! </p>
