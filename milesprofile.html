          <p> I'm Miles, a computer science student at Columbia university possibly majoring in linguistics. Not the intersection of the two though. While I"m not interested in Computational Linguistics, I am interested in computer graphics and languages in general. IN fact, I speak French and am learning Arabic, and English literature is one of my favorite hobbies. 

I used to run a lot but now I mostly watch netflix and cuddle with my girlfriend. I like geeky TV shows and superhero movies, though I hate the sexism that usually accompanies those genres. I'd like to see movies about female superheroes that don't objectify them, but that may be a long way away.  </p>
